      <li><strong>Birth and Pedigree</strong> - Rabindranath Tagore was born on 7th May 1861 to Maharshi Debendranath Tagore and Sarada Devi in the Jorasanko mansion (the ancestral home of the Tagore family) in Calcutta. His nickname was "Rabi" or "Robi". He was the youngest son among thirteen childrens. His father was a great Hindu philosopher and one of the founders of the religious movement, ‘Brahmo Samaj’. Prince  Dwarkanath Tagore was his grandfather.</li>
       <li><strong>Childhood and Early Life</strong> -  Tagore was very young when his mother died and since his father was away most of the time, he was raised by the domestic help. The Tagores were ardent art-lovers who were known throughout the Bengal for their dominant influence over Bengali culture and literature. Having been born in such a family, he was introduced to the world of theatre, music (both regional folk and Western) and literature from an early age.</li>
       <li><strong>Education</strong> - Rabindranath Tagore was educated at home due to lack interest in going Schools. His father sent him to Brighton, East Sussex, England when he was at 17 for formal schooling but Rabindranath failed to finish his studies. He returned to Bengal in 1880 without a degree, with the aspiration of fusing the elements of Bengali and European traditions in his literary works. Rabindranath never attained formal schools and colleges or studying and gathered knowledge and education reading at home and became famous by his writings.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Life</strong> - At the time of the marriage Rabindranath was 22 years old and Bhabatarini(Mrinalini Devi) was 12.  They got married on 9 December 1883. Together they had five childrens, but two died during childhood. They were Renuka Tagore, Rathindranath Tagore, Meera Tagore, Shamindranath Tagore, Madhurilata Tagore.</li>
      <li><strong>Literary Works</strong> - Known mostly for his poetry, Tagore wrote novels, essays, short stories, travelogues, dramas, and thousands of songs. Of Tagore's prose, his short stories are perhaps most highly regarded; he is indeed credited with originating the Bengali-language version of the genre. His works are frequently noted for their rhythmic, optimistic, and lyrical nature. </li>
      <p><strong>Drama</strong> : Tagore's experiences with drama began when he was sixteen, with his brother Jyotirindranath. He wrote his first original dramatic piece when he was twenty — Valmiki Pratibha which was shown at the Tagore's mansion. Tagore stated that his works sought to articulate "the play of feeling and not of action". In 1890 he wrote Visarjan (an adaptation of his novella Rajarshi), which has been regarded as his finest drama. The play Dak Ghar (The Post Office, 1912), describes the child Amal defying his stuffy and puerile confines by ultimately "falling asleep", hinting his physical death. A story with borderless appeal—gleaning rave reviews in Europe—Dak Ghar dealt with death as, in Tagore's words, "spiritual freedom" from "the world of hoarded wealth and certified creeds".  Another is Tagore's Chandalika (Untouchable Girl), which was modelled on an ancient Buddhist legend describing how Ananda, the Gautama Buddha's disciple, asks a tribal girl for water. In Raktakarabi ("Red" or "Blood Oleanders") is an allegorical struggle against a kleptocrat king who rules over the residents of Yaksha puri. Chitrangada, Chandalika, and Shyama are other key plays that have dance-drama adaptations, which together are known as Rabindra Nritya Natya. List of dramas are as follow:</p>
      <ol>
        <li type="i">Valmiki Pratibha</li>
        <li type="i">Rudrachanda</li>
        <li type="i">Nalini</li>
        <li type="i">Prakritir Pratisodh</li>
        <li type="i">Raja o Rani</li>
        <li type="i">Chitrangada</li>
        <li type="i">Visarjan etc.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Short Stories</strong> : Tagore began his career in short stories in 1877—when he was only sixteen—with "Bhikharini" ("The Beggar Woman"). The four years from 1891 to 1895 are known as Tagore's "Sadhana" period (named for one of Tagore's magazines). This period was among Tagore's most fecund, yielding more than half the stories contained in the three-volume Galpaguchchha, which itself is a collection of eighty-four stories. Tagore typically associated his earliest stories (such as those of the "Sadhana" period)  these characteristics were intimately connected with Tagore's life in the common villages of, among others, Patisar, Shajadpur, and Shilaida while managing the Tagore family's vast landholdings. In particular, such stories as "Kabuliwala" ("The Fruitseller from Kabul", published in 1892), "Kshudita Pashan" ("The Hungry Stones") (August 1895), and "Atithi" ("The Runaway", 1895) typified this analytic focus on the downtrodden.  Many of the other Galpaguchchha stories were written in Tagore's Sabuj Patra period from 1914 to 1917, also named after one of the magazines that Tagore edited and heavily contributed to. List of short stories are as follow:</p>
      <ol>
        <li type="i">Bhikarini</li>
        <li type="i">Korunna</li>
        <li type="i">Ghater Katha</li>
        <li type="i">Ginni</li>
        <li type="i">Post Master</li>
        <li type="i">Kabuliwallah</li>
        <li type="i">Denapaona etc.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Novels</strong> : Tagore wrote eight novels and four novellas, among them Chaturanga, Shesher Kobita, Char Odhay, and Noukadubi. Ghare Baire (The Home and the World)—through the lens of the idealistic zamindar protagonist Nikhil—excoriates rising Indian nationalism, terrorism, and religious zeal in the Swadeshi movement; a frank expression of Tagore's conflicted sentiments, it emerged from a 1914 bout of depression. Gora raises controversial questions regarding the Indian identity. In Jogajog (Relationships), the heroine Kumudini—bound by the ideals of Śiva-Sati, exemplified by Dākshāyani—is torn between her pity for the sinking fortunes of her progressive and compassionate elder brother and his foil: her roue of a husband. Others were uplifting: Shesher Kobita—translated twice as Last Poem and Farewell Song—is his most lyrical novel, with poems and rhythmic passages written by a poet protagonist. List of novels are as follow:</p>
      <ol>
        <li type="i">Bou Thakuranir Haat</li>
        <li type="i">Rajarshi</li>
        <li type="i">Chokher Bali</li>
        <li type="i">Nastanirh</li>
        <li type="i">Chirakumar Sabha</li>
        <li type="i">Noukadubi</li>
        <li type="i">Gora etc.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Poetry</strong> : Internationally, Gitanjali is Tagore's best-known collection of poetry, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1913. Besides Gitanjali, other notable works include Manasi, Sonar Tori ("Golden Boat"), Balaka ("Wild Geese" — the title being a metaphor for migrating souls). Tagore's poetic style, which proceeds from a lineage established by 15th- and 16th-century Vaishnava poets, ranges from classical formalism to the comic, visionary, and ecstatic. He was influenced by the atavistic mysticism of Vyasa and other rishi-authors of the Upanishads, the Bhakti-Sufi mystic Kabir, and Ramprasad Sen. Tagore's most innovative and mature poetry embodies his exposure to Bengali rural folk music, which included mystic Baul ballads such as those of the bard Lalon. The impact of nature and the emotional interplay of human drama, such tools saw use in his Bhānusiṃha poems chronicling the Radha-Krishna romance, which were repeatedly revised over the course of seventy years. List of poetries are as follow:</p>
      <ol>
        <li type="i">Kabi-Kahini</li>
        <li type="i">Bana-Phul</li>
        <li type="i">Bhagna Hriday</li>
        <li type="i">Sandhya Sangeet</li>
        <li type="i">Prabhat Sangeet</li>
        <li type="i">Bhanusimha Thakurer Padabali</li>
        <li type="i">Kari o Kamal etc.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Music(Rabindra Sangeet)</strong> : Tagore was also an excellent musician. He wrote around 2,230 songs. People call these songs "Rabindra Sangeet (which means "Tagore Song" in English). These songs are now a part of modern Bengali culture. Tagore's many poems and songs are parts of his novels and stories. His songs and music cover many aspects of human emotion, devotional hymns,to songs of love. In most Bengali-speaking families, people sing Rabindra Sangeet'. Among Rabindra Sangeet are two great works, which are now national anthems of two different countries: India and Bangladesh. This makes Tagore the only person in the world to have written the national anthems of two nations. They are Bangladesh's 'Amar Sonaar Baanglaa' and India's 'Jana Gana Mana'. The Sri Lanka's National Anthem was inspired by his work.</p>
      <p><strong>Art Works</strong> : Rabindranath Tagore was also an excellent painter who played an important role in modernising Bengali art. At sixty, Tagore took up drawing and painting; successful exhibitions of his many works which made a debut appearance in Paris upon encouragement by artists he met in the south of France—were held throughout Europe. He was likely red-green colour blind, resulting in works that exhibited strange colour schemes and off-beat aesthetics. Tagore was influenced numerous styles, including scrimshaw by the Malanggan people of northern New Ireland, Papua New Guinea, Haida carvings from the Pacific Northwest region of North America, and woodcuts by the German Max Pechstein. His artist's eye for his handwriting were revealed in the simple artistic and rhythmic leitmotifs embellishing the scribbles, cross-outs, and word layouts of his manuscripts. Some of Tagore's lyrics corresponded in a synesthetic sense with particular paintings.</p>
      <li><strong>Santiniketan and Visva-Bharati</strong> - Tagore despised rote classroom schooling: in "The Parrot's Training", a bird is caged and force-fed textbook pages—to death. Tagore, visiting Santa Barbara in 1917, conceived a new type of university: he sought to "make Santiniketan the connecting thread between India and the world and a world center for the study of humanity somewhere beyond the limits of nation and geography. The school, which he named Visva-Bharati, had its foundation stone laid on 24 December 1918 and was inaugurated precisely three years later. Tagore employed a brahmacharya system: gurus gave pupils personal guidance—emotional, intellectual, and spiritual. Teaching was often done under trees. He staffed the school, he contributed his Nobel Prize monies, and his duties as steward-mentor at Santiniketan kept him busy: mornings he taught classes; afternoons and evenings he wrote the students' textbooks. He fundraised widely for the school in Europe and the United States between 1919 and 1921.</li>
      <li><strong>Awards and Achievements</strong> - For his momentous and revolutionary literary works on 'Geetanjali', Tagore was honored with the Nobel Prize in Literature on 14 November 1913. He was also conferred knighthood in 1915, which he renounced in 1919 after the Jallianwallah Bagh carnage. In 1940, Oxford University awarded him with a Doctorate of Literature in a special ceremony arranged at Shantiniketan.</li>
      <li><strong>World Tours</strong> - Between 1878 and 1932, Tagore set foot in more than thirty countries on five continents. Since Rabindranath Tagore believed in the concept of one world, he set out on a world tour, in an attempt to spread his ideologies. He also lectured in countries like the United States and Japan. Soon after, Tagore found himself visiting places like Mexico, Singapore and Rome, where he met national leaders and important personalities including the likes of Einstein and Mussolini. In 1927, he embarked on a Southeast Asian tour and inspired many with his wisdom and literary works.</li>
      <li><strong>Last Days & Death</strong> - Rabindranath Tagore spent the last four years of his life in constant pain and was bogged down by two long bouts of illness. In 1937, he went into a comatose condition, which relapsed after a period of three years. After an extended period of suffering, Tagore died on August 7, 1941 in the same Jorasanko mansion in which he was brought up.</li>
